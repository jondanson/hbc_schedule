# hbc_schedule

This is to be a volunteer scheduling app for the Harvest Baptist CHurch of Mount Vernon, Washington.
If you're ever in town, please stop by and say hi.
Services are Sunday at 1030 and 6, and Wednesdays at 7.

For the first commitmuch of the app has been written.
Just before the initial commit I have been working on the views and jinja2 documents for the Admin.


Still TODO:
Get the webapp to open home page.
Figure out how to make the schedule run 7 days before the end of month and compile an email for each user for each event 
they are assigned to fo the following month.
